## Hi Iâ€™m Gordon a developer ðŸ§®, designer ðŸŽ¨, and artistðŸ‘¾

I make things and I have always made things. I studied art and visual communication at UC Berkeley. As an artist I constantly thought about how to effectively communicate the meaning in my work. I began to use my experience as an artist to communicate with users to solve their problems. 

To enhance my abilities I earned my UX Certificate from General Assembly in San Francisco. During the pandemic I taught myself front end development to deliver my designs.

I am currently a Developer at Rooster Grin Media. I volunteer as a Design Advisor for Design at Berkeley and I volunteer as a React Developer at Hawaii United Okinawan Association.

I love to make figma plugins https://www.figma.com/@glewis, draw and paint, and think about all the things I could make.

Reach out to me at glewis@berkeley.edu
